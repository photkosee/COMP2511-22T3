a. Code smells is where it uses switch statement and each of the cases are having different behavior based on their own state.

c. Currently we are having many different behaviors that are based on its state which could be extracted to a new class. This is why State pattern is a perfect solution for this case.

d. Composite pattern since it is constructing in a tree-like and would like to call subnode function to count all nodes and for iterator as well.
