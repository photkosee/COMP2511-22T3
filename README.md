# The Art of Software Design (OO Design & Programming) COMP2511 2022 Term 3

## Course Summary

This course aims to introduce students to the foundational principles of designing software that is flexible, reusable and maintainable. Students are exposed to the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm and explore how OOP attempts to solve the problem of good software design, while learning of other paradigms such as the functional paradigm. Students explore fundamental Design Patterns in writing and testing of software and their role in architecture of software, applying these solutions to both theoretical and real-world problems. The course teaches an appreciation for elegantly written code, problem solving and finding well-designed solutions to problems that have longevity of software systems in mind.
